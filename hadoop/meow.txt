1. Capacity analysis 
	- CPU utilization
	- number of thread increase
	- memory utilization
	- context switching -- understand it
	- JVM memory allocation and aspects of JVM
	- Connection pool
	- DB indexing  , index caching
	- DB Partitioning
	- Watch out for latencies
	- SOAP vs Restful vs plain HttpClient

DB Analysis
 
· Increased I/O wait time is noticed on DB servers.
· Queries involving audit log table show higher I/O activity presumably because of the size of table.
· Need to identify queries showing spikes up to 5-10 sec and determine if additional indexing is required.
 
Short-term goals
 
· Identify the number of records in sasactivities, sasaudit, rnvirtual and tokenuser table
· Provide queries to DBA to purge older records.
· To minimize the performance hit related to delete queries, use table truncate and re-import data process.
· Identify queries that are running slowly.
· Setup indexes on tables involving slow running queries.
· After older data is deleted, rebuild indexes one DC at a time.
	 
Long-term goals
· Partition needs to be introduced which depends on availability of additional disk.
· Creation of multiple tablespaces for data. DBA to decide which tables write to which tablespace depending on table growth and frequency & type of DMLs.
Determine the data retention policy for tables with faster growth rate.

Challenges  Observed 
	1. Static content inclusion into the webpages from other machines. This content is about the soft token download instructions. This content is prone to change frequently. LTM (weblogic appserver) hosting sasadmin application is trying to pull the content and combine it before committing the response.
	Implemented solution is <c:import file=download.jsp>.
	Since static content is on SHA1 certificate and LTM on SHA2. there was issues. We can not upgrade LTM to SHA2 because WSUUM is still on SHA1.
	Vadafone ??? How it is involved.
	2. Polling time calculation ? Deciding factors. Latency for SAS to Vendor to Mobile device.
