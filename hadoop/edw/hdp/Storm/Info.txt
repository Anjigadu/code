Key Points & Concepts
=====================
A storm cluster has three sets of nodes:

1. Nimbus node (master node, similar to the Hadoop JobTracker):
     Uploads computations for execution
     Distributes code across the cluster
     Launches workers across the cluster
     Monitors computation and reallocates workers as needed
2. ZooKeeper nodes – coordinates the Storm cluster
3. Supervisor nodes – communicates with Nimbus through Zookeeper, starts and stops workers according to signals from Nimbus
