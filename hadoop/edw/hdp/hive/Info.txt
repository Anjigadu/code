Difference between external and internal tables
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17038414/difference-between-hive-internal-tables-and-external-tables
warehouse-dir vs target-dir
What is Managed table vs External table
Why CTAS does not support partitioning and clustered (bucketing) or skewed.

Bucketing is 1 based???

Does Hive support indexing? How we can have faster searches?
     http://maheshwaranm.blogspot.com/2013/09/hive-indexing.html
      ex:  create INDEX test_column_index ON TABLE test_table(test_column) as
                 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler'  WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;
        
        Compact Index seems to store (value, block-id) pairs while Bitmap Index stores (value , list of rows as a bitmap)
        
Bit Map Index explained.  Good for less write and more read index tables.

Two possible ways of importing into Hive? 
  http://getindata.com/blog/post/surprising-sqoop-to-hive-gotchas/

What is -direct option ? faster import ?

How do we choose between partition vs bucketing ?

Did you use hive joins? in what scenario ?

can we create schema with primary key ? 

 SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;
 
 SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;

Static vs Dynamic Partitioning ?

Difference between SORT BY VS ORDER BY VS DISTRIBUTE BY VS CLUSTER BY
  http://www.javatpoint.com/hive-sort-by-order-by
    sort by ---- is specific to the data in a reducer. If multiple reducers are used. The final out might not be fully sorted.
    order by --- uses single reducer , thus guarantee total ordering of the data.

How many ways to get RDBMS data into HIVE? And pros n cons ?

copying schema to other cluster ??
    https://community.hortonworks.com/questions/4496/how-to-migrate-hive-data-over-to-new-cluster.html
    mysql -u hive -p -e " select concat(  'show create table ' , TBL_NAME,';') from TBLS" hive > file.sql
    
what are challenges you have faced in hive on your data ?
  1. unix date to hive representation
  2. Null presentations
  3. load issue to AWS S3 ?
     only external table is good.

Key Points & Concepts
=====================

Types of partition in RDBMS - list partitioning, hash partitioning , range partitioning...
Hive Partition
 - Partitioning --- similar to list partioning
         partition column may be part of table.
         column name needs data type
 - Bucketing --- similar to hash partioning
         Clustered or Sorted takes column from the table. Does require data type to be mentioned as it is already mentioned table.

hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true  ---> through insert dynamic partition can be done.
hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict --> In case of strict,  error is thrown if trying to do dynamic partition.

CTAS - Create Table As Select --- creating table with a select query.

hive.execution.engine=mr   or tez

explain ... query --- gives information about the stages and map and reduce tasks.

hive.txn.manager=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager

Hive Transaction    ---  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+Transactions
     To have transational behavior table needs to be orc (Optimized Row Columnar) , bucketing ,  tblproperties('transactional'='true'); 
Compactor
    Compactor is a set of background processes running inside the Metastore to support ACID system.  
    It consists of Initiator, Worker, Cleaner, AcidHouseKeeperService and a few others.


tombstone  -- it is indicator , that conveys the record has been delete. But the actual record would be existing.
              This concept is employed in HBase and Cassandra. This is due distributed database model.

We might need denormalize data - which can be used to get frequent different type of reports on the same set of denormalized data.


SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
SET hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions=2048;
SET hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions.pernode=256;
     Hive enforces a limit on the number of dynamic partitions it can create. 
     The default is 100 dynamic partitions per node, with a total (default) limit of 1000 dynamic partitions across all nodes.
     However, this setting is configurable. If your job tries to create more partitions than allowed, you may see the following exception:
