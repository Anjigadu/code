Concepts
===================
JMS Client 			- message producer or consumer
Service Provider	- Messaging system which implements JMS interface. Open JMS , JBOSS Messaging, MQ Series, Active MQ
Messages			- Objects used to communicate between clients.
Administered Objects- These are two types of preconfigured objects
	Connection factory  - Provides connection between JMS Client and Service Provider
	Destination			- Is an Object into which JMS Client targets/receives its messages to and from.
	
	An administered tool binds the administered objects â€“ Connection factories and destinations ,to the  JNDI name space. 
	
Native Client		- They message product native API instead of JMS API.
	
MESSAGING Domains
	Point - to - Point
		One sender, One Queue , one receiver
	Publish / Subscribe
		Client subscription to the TOPIC required.
		Client should be active to receive messages
		

		
Building Blocks
	Administered Objects --- connection factories and destinations
	JNDI look up
	Session - Single threaded context for Producing and Consuming messages
	Message Producer - Created from Session
	Message Consumer - Created from Session
	Message Selector - To filter messages received
	Message 		 - Object targeted to topic/queue and has 3 parts
		header		- predefined fields for proper delivery and routing
		body		- body of messages. 5 types allowed by JMS API.
			Text Message	- String data
			Byte Message	- byte data
			Map Message		- key/value
			Stream Message	- Stream of primitive values
			Object Message	- body contains Object
			Message			- Nothing in the body. Only has header.
		properties	- additional properties other than header.
		
RELIABILITY MECHANISM IN JMS
	Specifying message persistence			- Message persisted in the case of failure of JMS Provider. send() / publish()
		Persistence Delivery mode - Default - DeliveryMode.PERSISTENCE = 2
		Non-Persistence Delivery mode - NON_DeliveryMode.PERSISTENCE = 1
	Setting Message Priority Levels			- Message with Higher priority levels will be delivered first. 0 to 9 . Default is 4.
	Allow Message to expire					- Message with expiration time. Default message never expires.
	Controlling Message Acknowledgements	- Can make various levels of control over ACK of messages.
	Creating Temporary Destinations			- Created in programs. Message reliability is still assured.
	Creating Durable Subscription			- Message is still would be sustained even if the subscriber is inactive.
